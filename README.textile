h1. roll_password

This is a shell script, which rolls a random passphrase based of a diceware wordlist. It's as random as the bash RANDOM random is. So do not use it for key signing or crypto stuff. But it's random enough for online service.

You can choose the wordlist file, the number of words and the minimum length of the password.
